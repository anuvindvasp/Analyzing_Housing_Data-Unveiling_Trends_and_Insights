## FEATURE ENGINEERING
Transforming raw data into features that better represent the underlying patterns in the data.

* Age of Property :
Calculate the age of a property based on the construction year.

* Price Per Square Foot :
Derive the price per square foot by dividing the price by the living space square footage.


## INSIGHTS : ANALYSING KEY DRIVERS 

* Location : Prices vary across cities, with certain cities showing consistently higher values.

* Property Condition : Examine the impact of overall condition and renovation history on housing prices.

* Property Size : Investigate the relationship between square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms with housing prices.

* Property Prices : Larger properties with more features, such as higher square footage, more bedrooms, and better conditions, tend to have higher prices.


## CONCLUSION

* Comprehensive analysis identified key factors influencing housing and it‚Äôs pricing.

* Providing actionable insights for pricing, investment, and property development strategies.

* Analyzing market dynamics and potential shifts in housing demand and pricing.

* Improving property condition through renovations can lead to substantial price increases and better marketability.

* The relationship between condition and price is consistent across cities, though high-demand cities show a stronger impact.
